According to Theresa's foster mom, she is generally calm and well-behaved in the house, with a daily bout of 'zoomies' during which Theresa scampers around in a brief burst of ecstatic energy! If you've never seen a dog with the zoomies, then you haven't really lived!  Theresa is polite and friendly with new people, but her heart will belong to her adopter. She adores her foster mom and is happiest when she has her Special Someone(s) in close proximity. Theresa is no fair-weather pooch - when she loves, she gives it her whole heart and soul... and hindquarters... her whole back-end wiggles in delight when she sees her favorite people!  Theresa enjoys car rides, long walks, lots of naps, food puzzles, stuffed toys, butt scratches, and snuggling on the sofa with you at the end of the day.   Theresa would probably prefer to be the only dog in the home. She is fine with seeing other dogs when she is out on walks, but she doesn't seem interested in actually spending time with them - she is all about her human(s)!  Theresa has a bit of prey drive, so Squirrels Beware! In general she is a delight on-leash, but if a bunny or squirrel crosses her path, she has to let them know who's boss!  Theresa is truly a charming, well-mannered love-bug. Were she not a 'senior' she would have been adopted long ago, but as it stands she has been at the shelter since May, waiting and hoping for a person to call her own. Currently Theresa visits her foster home during the week, and comes back to the shelter over the weekends with the hope of being adopted. If you are interested in getting to know this sweet girl, her foster parent would be delighted to have you meet Theresa at her foster home, where she is more relaxed than when she is at the shelter. Just contact the Adoption Department at Seattle Humane and they will gladly help arrange a Meet-and-Greet!  As with all of our dogs, Theresa has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated and behavior-tested. She will go home with a certificate for an examination by a King County veterinarian and an identification tag. PLUS, most dog adoptions include 30 days of pet insurance from Trupanion and a training rebate when you complete a dog behavior course - a great way to start off on the right paw!  Introduce to children 14 years and older. Resident dogs are required to visit Theresa prior to adoption.
